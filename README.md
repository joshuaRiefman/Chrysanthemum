# Chrysanthemum

## What is Chrysanthemum?

Chrysanthemum is a neural network that aims to approximate a solution to the travelling salesman problem. Built in C++, Chrysanthemum's end goal is to be able to take in a list of cities and the distances between each, and to find a path to each city and back to the original that minimizes distance travelled. 

## How to use Chrysanthemum

Chrysanthemum is currently in-progress. At the moment, Chrysanthemum's neural network is fully functional, but lacks a learning algorithm which is the next step in its development. To use Chrysanthemum, clone this repository and run the executable. Ulysses (https://github.com/joshuaRiefman/Ulysses) was built for the purpose of providing city data and visualizing the path created by Chrysanthemum, but you can use another program to provide and handle this data.
