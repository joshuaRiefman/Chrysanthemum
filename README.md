## What is Chrysanthemum?

Chrysanthemum is a neural network that aims to approximate a solution to the travelling salesman problem. Built in C++, Chrysanthemum's end goal is to be able to take in a list of cities and the distances between each, and to find a path to each city and back to the original that minimizes distance travelled.
